# How hypergraph-to-graph conversion affects cooperative working visualization: A Multi-metric evaluation

## Overview

This is the code repository for "How hypergraph-to-graph conversion affects cooperative working visualization: A Multi-metric evaluation". In our study, we propose an appraisal frame work in which we use qualitative and quantitative metrics including 1) concavity, 2) planarity, 3) coverage rate of the plane, 4) regularity, and 5) cognitive capacity of data to assess the performance of each conversion method in terms of layout quality and effectiveness. The results show that while no method is ideal for all situations, certain methods, such as Centroid-single, perform well in general. Researchers can use our experiment results to select the optimal method tailored to their specific dataset and circumstances. This paper serves as researchers and practitioners choose the most suitable conversion method for their research.
